\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstraction}
We extend a behavioral type system with dependent types for a program
language with manual memory management primitives. The extended type system
describes more precise behavior information for a program, which not
only can abstract behavior of a program but also deal with
path-sensitive statement. By using our current type system with
another safe memory deallocation tools, we can even guarantee
memory-leak free for nonterminating programs.
