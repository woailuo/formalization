Memory usage is a crucial issue for real-world program, so lots of
static verification method for memory usage have been
proposed~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09,DBLP:conf/pldi/HeineL03,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/XieA05,DBLP:journals/scp/SwamyHMGJ06,DBLP:conf/sas/OrlovichR06,DBLP:conf/issta/SuiYX12}. However,
these static methods only guaranteed partial memory-leak freedom and
lack of illegal accessing of dangling pointer.  In our previous
work~\cite{}, we proposed a behavioral type system, inspired by
Kobayashi et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/lmcs/KobayashiSW06} which
guarantees safety properties of resources usage for concurrent
programs, to estimate the upper bound number of memory cells a program
consumes and even guarantee memory-leak freedome for nonterminationg
programs with other static methods. But verification failed for
path-sensitive programs, therefore we extend previous behavioral type
system with dependent type system.

The dependent types...
